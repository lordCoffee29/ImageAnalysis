# ImageAnalysis

Weather prediction provides important information that organizations/individuals can use to help mitigate weather related losses. Because of the sheer amount of locations that exist across the planet, it is infeasible for people to individually classify the kind of weather occuring in different areas.

The dataset we chose is Weather Image Recognition data from the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset?resource=download.

This data includes 6862 images of different types of weather spread across 11 different categories: dew, fog/smog, frost, glaze, hail, lightning, rain, rainbow, rime, sandstorm, and snow.

We hope our analysis can help weather organizations understand how to classify different kinds of weather
